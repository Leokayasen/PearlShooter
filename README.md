# UntitledUnderwaterPearlShooter
Basic physics simulation presenting effects of particles underwater (with added features ofc!)

## How do I play?
It's very simple!

"Home" to get back to the Main Menu from the "Game" state.

"Esc" to exit and close the game from the "Game" state.

"Space" to fire the "bullets"

To control the aiming, click and drag "Left Click"


Due to conflicting inputs, only keybinds work when in the simulation mode. (sorry!)


## Can I fork and make my own version?
This Repository will contain all main versions of the program, along with untested or unfinished copies in a separate folder.


## License and Requirements
