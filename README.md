# UntitledUnderwaterPearlShooter
Basic physics simulation presenting effects of particles underwater (with added features ofc!)

## What's new?
As of 15/03/2024, this game is no longer receiving updates or support.
While it is a shame, as I thoroughly enjoyed developing this, I have included the executable file along with its dependencies in a zip folder.


## How do I play?
First, download the zip folder onto your desktop or games folder.
Second, extract the zip - Make sure you do not change the extracted folder name or any of its contents.
Third, open the folder and find the PearlShooter.exe file (it may be named slightly differently)
Without changing anything, run the executable.
Now, enjoy the very limited features of this demo!

## Controls
"Home" to get back to the Main Menu from the "Game" state.

"Esc" to exit and close the game from the "Game" state.

"Space" to fire the "bullets"

To control the aiming, click and drag "Left Click"


Due to conflicting inputs, only keybinds work when in the simulation mode. (sorry!)


## Can I fork and make my own version?
This Repository will contain all main versions of the program, along with untested or unfinished copies in a separate folder.


## License and Requirements
As you can see in the directory, I've included GNU GPL v3.0 to this.

All repositories I release publicly, are listed under the (GNU v3.0) license.
Read the license file to see how it works.
